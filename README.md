# fun-spec
The fun Instruction-set Architecture Specification v.0.1

## What is fun

fun is an open-specification instruction-set architecture (ISA) for structured combinator graph reduction, originally developed at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Its goal is to bring functional programming down to the architecture layer, avoiding the inconveniences and troubles of imperative programming that plague conventional ISAs.

## Features
fun is a purely-functional instruction set architecture that defines a language based on
structured combinators, for applications where isolation, purity and the way computation
is actually performed are the central concerns. fun is:
* An open, free and community-driven instruction-set architecture;
* The first purely-functional instruction set based on combinators to follow a modern,
proven path of other RISC architectures;
* A purely-functional instruction set for which memory handling, control flow and other
stateful and effectful behaviors is unrepresentable.
* An instruction set for efficient implementation of high-level purely-functional programming languages.
